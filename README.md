ci-presenter
============

CodeIgniter Presenter Library is a library that will add another layer of abstraction between the Controller and the views.

---

### LOADING THE LIBRARY

`$this->load->library('presenter');`

Although probably you want to auto-load this library since you're going to use it all the time.

---
### Using a object with the Presenter

	public function index()
	{
		/*
		Creating your object
		Normally this would be a result from a model
		*/
		$obj = new stdClass();
		$obj->name = 'Testproduct';
		$obj->key = 'T1';
		$obj->price = 1000;

		$this->load->library('presenter');
		$data['presenter'] = $this->presenter->create('example', $obj);

		$this->load->view('welcome_message', $data);
	}

- The 1st param for the create method is the name of your presenter without the _presenter.php

- All presenters must be stored at: ./application/presenters/

- Your second param is the object with all the data that you need.

---

### CREATING YOUR PRESENTER

Your presenter must always extend to the presenter library.


	<?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

	class Example_Presenter extends Presenter {

	}

	/* End of file example_presenter.php */
	/* Location: ./application/presenters/example_presenter.php */

---

### AUTOMATICALLY CALLING YOUR METHODS

If you have your object with 3 properties, and you want to present each one in a different way. For that you just have to create your methods in your presenter with the prefix of **transform_**.

Example:

**Your object:**

	$obj = new stdClass();
	$obj->name = 'Testproduct';
	$obj->key = 'T1';
	$obj->price = 1000;

**The 3 methods in your presenter:**

	public function transform_price($price)
	{
		return $price ? number_format($price, 2, '.', ',').' &euro;' : 'N/A';
	}

	public function transform_name($name)
	{
		return $name ? $this->key('T2').' '.$name : 'N/A';
	}

	public function transform_key($key)
	{
		return $key ? '<b>'.$key.'</b>' : 'N/A';
	}

### Looping your data and rendering html

At some point we all had a bunch of data that we needed to loop from begining to end and show it in a specific way. That can be achieved with the presenters.

**Imagine you have this object:**

	$objs = array();

	$obj = new stdClass();
	$obj->key = 'T1';
	$obj->name = 'Testproduct';
	$obj->price = 1000;
	array_push($objs, $obj);

	$obj = new stdClass();
	$obj->name = 'Second Testproduct';
	$obj->key = 'T2';
	$obj->price = 12345;
	array_push($objs, $obj);

	$obj = new stdClass();
	$obj->name = 'Third Testproduct';
	$obj->key = 'T3';
	$obj->price = 500;
	array_push($objs, $obj);

**You load your presenter with that object**

	$this->load->library('presenter');
	$data['presenter'] = $this->presenter->create('example', $objs);

**In your presenter you just have to do this:**

	<?php if ( ! defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

	class Example_Presenter extends Presenter {

		public function list_items()
		{
			$html = '<p>#key# #name#<br> This item costs: #price#<p>';
			return $this->_generate_output($html);
		}
	}

You just have to wrap your items with a # and your html. Then you just need to return your data with the method called **_generate_output();**

Like any other presenter method this should use used in your view like this:

	<?= $presenter->list_items() ?>

### Looping your data and rendering html WITH PARTIALS

Allright, we want to get rid of that HTML within our presenter. So let's take a look at *partials*. In this example we use the same object collection as above and create the presenter object, which will be passed to the view.
But instead of creating a method in our presenter that contains the HTML-Snippet we do this:

**Create the partial**

First we create our partial file: `/application/views/partials/example/list_products.php`
There are a few rules to follow, which allow to autoload the partials:

* All partials go into `/application/views/partials`
* If our presenter's class is `Example_Presenter`, we have to create a subfolder called `example` in our partials directory
* Within this directory the partials cann be called whatever you like. Just make sure all filenames end with `.php`

Let's make an easy partial containing only this peace of code

    <p>Listing: Product #name# costs #price# </p>

Note that all properties of our object look like this. `#property_name#`
This allows the presenter to replace the keys with our properties' values.
And if we have matching transformation methods, they will be called too!

So all we have to do now is getting our output.
In your view just put this:

    <?= $presenter->partial('list_products) ?>

Et voil√†, the included magic, and white rabbits have done the rest for you, and **present** you with some nice output.

Tadaaaa.
